## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

Follow these steps to get a local instance of the backend up and running.

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
- A [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance (local or in the cloud like MongoDB Atlas)

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-app-backend.git # Replace with your repository URL
cd food-app-backend
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project's root directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root. You can copy the `.env.sample` file as a starting point:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Then, edit the `.env` file with your own credentials and settings. At a minimum, you will need:

```env
# MongoDB
MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_uri_here" # Example: mongodb://localhost:27017/food-app

# Server
PORT=3001 # Port the server will run on

# API
API_PREFIX="/api/v1" # Prefix for all API routes

# JWT (if authentication is implemented)
# JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_jwt_key"
# JWT_EXPIRES_IN="1d"
```

Make sure your MongoDB instance is running and accessible.

### 5. Start the Server

To start the server in development mode (with hot-reloading thanks to `ts-node-dev`):

```bash
yarn dev
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3001` (or the port you configured in `.env`). You will see logs in the console indicating that the server has started and connected to the database.

To compile the project for production:
```bash
yarn build
```
And to run the compiled code:
```bash
yarn start
```

---

## üìú Available Scripts

In the `package.json` file, you will find the following main scripts:

- `yarn dev`: Starts the server in development mode using `ts-node-dev`. Ideal for local development due to its hot-reloading feature.
- `yarn build`: Compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript in the `dist/` directory.
- `yarn start`: Runs the compiled code in production mode.
- `yarn test`: (Placeholder) Runs automated tests (see [Testing](#-testing) section).
- `yarn run lint`: (Placeholder) Runs the linter to check code quality.
- `yarn run format`: (Placeholder) Formats the code using Prettier.

---

## üîß Key Utilities & Design Choices

- **`responseTransformer.ts`**: Located in `src/utils/`, this utility is crucial for standardizing API responses. It automatically converts Mongoose documents to plain objects, renames `_id` to `id` (as a string), and removes the `__v` field. This ensures the frontend receives consistent and clean data, regardless of Mongoose's internal structure.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The project follows a design pattern where `controllers` handle HTTP requests, `services` contain business logic and database interaction, and `models` define the data structure. The `routes` define the endpoints and connect them to the corresponding `controllers`.
- **Middlewares**: Middlewares are used for cross-cutting concerns such as security (`helmet`, `cors`), logging (`morgan`), and potentially for authentication and centralized error handling.

---

## üìÑ API Documentation

This project uses Swagger to provide live, interactive API documentation. You can use this interface to view all available endpoints, see their parameters and schemas, and test them directly from your browser.

**How to access:**

1.  Ensure the development server is running:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

2.  Open your browser and navigate to:
    [**http://localhost:3001/api-docs**](http://localhost:3001/api-docs) (OpenAPI)

---

## üß™ Testing

Currently, the project may not have an exhaustive test suite, but it is structured to facilitate the implementation of:

- **Unit Tests:** To test isolated units of code (functions, services) using frameworks like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). For Mongoose, [mockingoose](https://github.com/alonronin/mockingoose) or manual mocks can be used.
- **Integration Tests:** To test the interaction between different parts of the system (e.g., routes -> controllers -> services -> database) using [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) for HTTP requests and a test database.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** (Less common for pure backends, but possible) To test the complete application flow.

**Suggested commands (to be implemented in `package.json`):**
```bash
npm test # Runs all tests
npm run test:unit # Runs unit tests
npm run test:integration # Runs integration tests
npm run test:coverage # Generates a test coverage report
```

---

## üíÖ Code Quality

To maintain clean, consistent, and error-free code, the following are recommended:

- **ESLint:** For static code analysis and finding issues. Configure with plugins for TypeScript (`@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`) and project-specific rules.
- **Prettier:** For automatic code formatting, ensuring a consistent style.
- **TypeScript Strict Mode:** Enable `strict: true` in `tsconfig.json` for more robust typing and to avoid common errors.
- **Husky & lint-staged:** (Optional) To run linters and formatters automatically before each commit.

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This Node.js/Express backend can be deployed on various platforms:

- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):**
  - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
  - [Render](https://render.com/)
  - [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)
  - Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- **Containers:**
  - Dockerize the application and deploy to services like AWS ECS, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), or any host that supports Docker.
- **Virtual Servers (VPS):**
  - Configure a server (e.g., on DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS EC2) with Node.js, a process manager like PM2, and a reverse proxy like Nginx.

**Production Considerations:**
- Ensure environment variables (especially `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`) are configured securely.
- Use `npm start`, which runs the compiled code.
- Configure appropriate logging for production.
- Implement HTTPS.

## üí° Potential Improvements & Future Work

This project has a solid foundation, but there is always room to grow and improve:

- **Robust Authentication:** Implement full JWT-based authentication, including registration, login, refresh tokens, and route protection.
- **Authorization and Roles:** Add a role-based access control (RBAC) system.
- **Advanced Input Validation:** Use libraries like `zod`, `joi`, or `class-validator` for more detailed and declarative validation of API input data.
- **Centralized and Detailed Error Handling:** Improve the error-handling middleware to provide more consistent and useful error responses.

- **Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting:** Implement these features on endpoints that return lists of resources.
- **Database Query Optimization:** Add indexes in MongoDB, optimize complex queries.
- **Database Transactions:** For operations that require multiple atomic changes.
- **WebSockets:** For real-time features (e.g., notifications).
- **Exhaustive Testing:** Increase unit and integration test coverage.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
- **Containerization with Docker:** Facilitate development and deployment.
- **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** To protect the API from abuse.
- **Advanced Logging:** Integrate with centralized logging services (e.g., Sentry, Logtail).
